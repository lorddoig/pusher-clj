A thin convenience wrapper around the official pusher Java library.

It currently only supports public channels; private channels, presence subscriptions,
and authorization are still TODO.  Contributions welcome.

## Usage

Requires Clojure 1.9.0+ as it uses `spec` for data validation.

The client is constructed with a pusher application key and a single callback
that will handle all messages; this gives flexibility for you to use `core.async`
or whatever other mechanism you like to process messages.  In a nutshell:

```clojure
(let [client (-> (new-client "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" (fn callback [[msg-type data :as payload]]
                                                     (println payload)))
                   (connect!))]
    ;; callback receives and prints:
    [:pusher-clj.connection/state-transition
     [:pusher-clj.connection/disconnected :pusher-clj.connection/connecting]]
    [:pusher-clj.connection/state-transition
     [:pusher-clj.connection/connecting :pusher-clj.connection/connected]]
    
    
    (subscribe! client "my_channel" ["event1" "event2"])

    ;; callback receives and prints:
    [:pusher-clj.core/subscribed "my_channel"]
    [:pusher-clj.core/msg ["my_channel" "event2" "some-data"]]
    [:pusher-clj.core/msg ["my_channel" "event1" "some-data"]]
    [:pusher-clj.core/msg ["my_channel" "event2" "some-data"]]


    (unsubscribe! client "my_channel" ["event2"])
    
    ;; messages for event2 stop being received:
    [:pusher-clj.core/msg ["my_channel" "event1" "some-data"]]
    [:pusher-clj.core/msg ["my_channel" "event1" "some-data"]]
    
    (disconnect! client)
    
    ;; callback receives and prints the following, after which no more messages
    ;; are received until...
    [:pusher-clj.connection/state-transition
     [:pusher-clj.connection/connected :pusher-clj.connection/disconnecting]]
    [:pusher-clj.connection/state-transition
     [:pusher-clj.connection/disconnecting :pusher-clj.connection/disconnected]]
    
    (connect! client)
    
    ;;...the client is reconnected using `connect!`; subscriptions are preserved:
    [:pusher-clj.connection/state-transition
     [:pusher-clj.connection/disconnected :pusher-clj.connection/connecting]]
    [:pusher-clj.connection/state-transition
     [:pusher-clj.connection/connecting :pusher-clj.connection/connected]]
    [:pusher-clj.core/msg ["my_channel" "event1" "some-data"]]
    [:pusher-clj.core/msg ["my_channel" "event1" "some-data"]]
    )
```

There are various specs defining the shape of the data this library passes around.
You can use them with `s/conform` and friends, but are especially useful as documentation.
Currently, specs are colocated with the functions/data structures with which they
are used, see [core.clj](src/com/lorddoig/pusher_clj/core.clj) for examples.
